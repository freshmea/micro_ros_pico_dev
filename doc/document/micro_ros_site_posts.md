<a id="source-posts-2019-03-19-system-modes-released-md"></a>

We just released the **[ROS 2 system modes package](https://github.com/microROS/system_modes)** that implements our attempt to allow behavioral system composition for ROS 2. *System modes* assume that the system is built from components with a lifecycle (see [ROS 2 managed nodes](https://github.com/ros2/demos/blob/master/lifecycle/README.rst)). It adds a notion of **(sub-)systems**, hierarchically grouping these nodes, as well as a notion of **modes** that determine the configuration of these nodes and (sub-)systems in terms of their parameter values.

Check the [system_modes example package](https://github.com/micro-ROS/system_modes/tree/master/system_modes_examples) for a small step-by-step example. For more information, check the [ROS wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/system_modes) and the [system_modes package on github](https://github.com/micro-ROS/system_modes).

The [European Robotics Forum](https://eu-robotics.net/european-robotics-forum/), the most influential meeting of the robotics community in Europe, was held in Bucharest, Romania, in March 2019. Over 900 European robotics top experts attended the 10th edition of the conference.

OFERA consortium, taking advantage of the opportunity, arranged one of their face-to-face meetings the days before the ERF as some of the members will also be attending to the forum.

In the forum and as part of the TG Software & System Engineering Meeting, Ingo Luetkebohle from Bosch and Borja Outerelo from eProsima presented an overview of the micro-ROS project, exposing the challenges it faces and the involvement of the community via a demo and the ROS 2 Embedded SIG.

The micro-ROS community demo was presented, making use of a Kobuki, one of the project reference platforms, Olimex STM32 E407 and micro-ROS stack. This community use case was also present in the exibitions area, as part of the Bosch booth.

ROS-Industrial Consortium Europe (RIC-EU) hosted a Spring 2019 edition of their RIC-EU Tech Workshop.
This edition took place on the 6th and 7th of May at Fraunhofer IPA in Stuttgart, Germany.
This workshop was focused on DDS and ROS 2 developments for which members of the EU project OFERA were invited as Speakers.
The OFERA members who assisted were Ralph Lange and Ingo Lütkebohle from BOSCH research and Jaime Martin and Borja Outerelo from eProsima.

The workshop was split in two days, the first one was focused on DDS and an introduction to ROS 2, presented by Jaime Martin and Borja Outerelo respectively.
The first half of the second day was filled with ROS 2 and micro-ROS presentations, from BOSCH partners, Ralph and Ingo.
The second day was closed by Fraunhofer IPA representatives, Ludovic Delval and Harsh Deshpande presenting the migration of packages from ROS 1 to ROS 2.

On day 1 and after the workshop presentation done by RIC-EU manager Thilo Zimmermann, Borja provided some rationale on the usage of DDS in the ROS 2 implementation and a hands-on with ros2 tools.

Following this presentation, Jaime in-depth explained DDS concepts and eProsima DDS implementation.
During this presentation, the assistants got the chance to use eProsima FastRTPS during a hands-on with their ShapesDemo and played around with some of the DDS QoS on top of a traditional "hello world" example.

Staring Day 2, Ralph Lange gave an in-depth presentation of the current status of ROS 2 and some of the changes for the upcoming release, Dashing Diademata.
Assistants had the chance to practice with ROS 2 with several hands-on parts proposed during the presentation.

<a id="source-posts-2019-06-03-micro-ros-temperature-publisher-demo-md"></a>

This demo shows a use case in which one micro-ROS client publishes temperature value from a sensor using a micro-ROS bridge as a gateway to ROS 2.
To run this demo, we will use an Olimex-STM32-E407 board with an HIH6130 temperature/humidity sensor and Raspberry Pi which works as a bridge.
The Olimex board runs a micro-ROS client, in this client, we will bring-up a node and a topic, and it will publish the measured value of the sensor.
At the same time, the Olimex board is connected by serial to a Raspberry Pi, which is running a micro-ROS agent. This micro-ROS agent will act as a gateway to the ROS 2 world, publishing this topic and making it visible from any device which runs ROS 2 in the same network.

The next video shows this demo running.

<a id="source-posts-2019-07-10-paper-and-industrial-pitch-at-ecrts-md"></a>

[ECRTS (Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems)](https://www.ecrts.org/) is one of the most important scientific conferences of the real-time community. This year's edition was held from 9 to 12 July in Stuttgart, Germany.

## Paper on a Response-Time Analysis of ROS 2

Tobias Blass, PhD student at Bosch Research and supervised by Björn B. Brandenburg of the Real-Time Systems Group of the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, presented the paper

*Daniel Casini, Tobias Blass, Ingo Lütkebohle, and Björn B. Brandenburg: "Response-Time Analysis of ROS 2 Processing Chains Under Reservation-Based Scheduling". Proc. of ECRTS '19. Stuttgart, Germany. July 2019.*

which is available at [http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2019/10743/](http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2019/10743/). One of the major contribution is a formal scheduling model of the ROS 2 rclcpp Executor. The results of this research have been also discussed in the new [ROS 2 Real-Time Working Group](https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-real-time-working-group-online-meeting-may-20th-2019-between-7am-and-8am-pdt-utc-7/9196) and they are an important input for the work on an rcl-level Executor in micro-ROS.

## Industrial Pitch on Real-Time Execution Mechanisms

Ralph Lange from Bosch Research motivated the need for practical and easy-to-use real-time execution mechanisms for ROS in the industrial pitch session and the subsequent poster session. As a matter of course, on the [poster](/download/2019-07-10_Real-time_in_robotics_Industrial_pitch_at_ECRTS.pdf), he also present the micro-ROS project and the plans for an rcl-level Executor with LET semantics.

The [**IoT Solutions World Congress (IOTSWC)**](https://www.iotsworldcongress.com/) is an annual fair and congress on IoT in Barcelona and has been established in 2015. With more than 300 exhibitors and more than 15000 visitors, IOTSWC calls itself the "largest IoT event in the world to get inspired with new ideas, solutions and people."

This year, we &ndash; the OFERA EU project consortium behind micro-ROS &ndash; got the opportunity to present micro-ROS at the IOTSWC on a booth organized by our project partner FIWARE

FIWARE’s marketing team designed a [**six-page brochure (PDF)**](/download/micro-ROS_Brochure.pdf) and a 4-minute explainer video (see above) on micro-ROS. In addition, FIWARE organized the whole booth design and construction. Yet, most important, they attracted thousands of visitors by the most beautiful exhibit on the fair: a 12m² LEGO city illustrating different IoT use-cases with tiny sensors, displays, and actuators.

The micro-ROS display was next to this LEGO city. Juan Flores and Ralph Lange, who did the booth service for micro-ROS during the three-day event, had their hands full. From the micro-ROS team, Bosch and eProsima had prepared a demo on micro-ROS with a Kobuki platform and a drone. One the first day, this demo was shown more than a hundred times.

About half of the visitors had never heard of ROS before. The fact that ROS and micro-ROS come under very permissive open-source licenses was appreciated explicitly by most of them. A number of visitors had already worked with ROS 1 and were eager to learn more about ROS 2 and micro-ROS. Yet, there were even visitors with hands-on experience with the micro-ROS stack.

ROSCon ([https://roscon.ros.org](https://roscon.ros.org/)) is the most important event of the ROS community. 
The 2019 edition was held in Macau, China.
This edition has been the biggest to date with about 700 attendants.

During this year's event, micro-ROS was present in two different ways: a talk and booths on the exhibition floor.

## Talk

![Ingo&BorjaPresentation](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EIRm9RPXYAAKwnN?format=jpg&name=large){:.img-responsive and style="max-width: 60%; float: right; padding-left: 10px"}
During the second day, Ingo and Borja presented micro-ROS to the ROS community.
They presented the current status of the framework and supplement with some rationale on why to use it and why we need microcontrollers in robots.

## Exhibition

Within the exhibition floor, there were two booths with material directly related to micro-ROS, Bosch Corporate Research booth, and eProsima's.
In the Bosch booth, they had the next evolution of the micro-ROS community demo based on a Kobuki platform with different hardware setup and some premier of the upcoming updates to come.

The eProsima booth was divided into two different spaces, one dedicated to Fast RTPS, their well known DDS implementation powering ROS 2 communications.
The other space was dedicated to microcontrollers development with Micro XRCE-DDS and micro-ROS as main attractions.
In this "micro" area, there was a TV showing a reel presentation of micro-ROS, the video prepared by FIWARE marketing team, and PIAP's video on benchmarking.
Also, in this area, and grabbing almost all the attraction of the public, there were two different micro-ROS demonstrations:
* A first demonstration using a Crazyflie 2.1 and sending data to the RVIz, which was visualized on the TV screen.
* A second Crazyflie 2.1 issuing commands to a Kobuki platform to move it.

## Raising interest

During the whole duration of the conference, micro-ROS attracted much attention, and the demonstration was continuously being shown and explained.
Most of the visitors were already working on microcontrollers. They also had an interest in communicating with ROS 2 but struggling their way to through, that is one of the reasons why micro-ROS attracted their attention.

As final remark.
Aside from members of the EU project OFERA, Renesas was showcasing the use of Micro XRCE-DDS in their RX65N MCU based platform, GR-ROSE.

The 11th edition of the [**European Robotics Forum (ERF)**](https://eu-robotics.net/european-robotics-forum/) was held in Malaga, Spain from 3rd to 5th March 2020. The ERF is one of the most important events in the European robotics community and especially the place where almost all EU-funded robotics projects present their works.

All partners of the EU project behind micro-ROS together organized a booth to display our latest developments. Most important, we showed a demo with a Kobuki platform, a Crazyflie quadcopter, and an IoT sensor running three different RTOS (NuttX, FreeRTOS, and Zephyr) supported by micro-ROS. In the front right of the following photo, you can also see our demo box to illustrate the different boot times and power consumptions of microprocessors versus microcontrollers running ROS 2 and micro-ROS, respectively.

<img alt="micro-ROS display" src="img/_posts/2020-03-03-micro-ROS-at-ERF2020_photo1.jpg" width="100%"/>

Our booth attracted a lot of interest: Many attendees visited us not only to talk about the demos and the status of micro-ROS, but also to discuss on the latest ROS 2 developments.

In the ERF workshop on "Overcoming the boundaries of today's Robotics Software Engineering", Ralph Lange from Bosch Corporate Research also had the possibility to provide a [short update on micro-ROS](/download/2020-03-04_micro-ROS_talk_at_ERF.pdf).

Automation is the key to development within the supply chain and logistics sectors, as it has the potential to improve productivity while reducing costs and protecting workers’ health.

At its most basic, an automated warehouse attempts to cut down on manual tasks that slow down the movement of goods, and to minimize the exposure of human workers to potential hazards. As robotics evolves, ever more warehouses plan to increase their investment in technology, with a focus on automation and scheduling tools. 

Below, we present a demo that exemplifies the potential entailed by micro-ROS to act as a first-line player in the next generation of robotics applications in the logistics sector.

It showcases a ROS 2 enabled robotic arm (Robotis OpenMANIPULATOR-X) connected to a ST VL53l1X ToF sensor able to measure the distance between a target object and the base of the arm.
The sensor is operated by an Olimex STM32-E407 development board, which features a STM32F407 microcontroller running Zephyr, a Real-Time Operating System that is especially convenient thanks to the large collection of sensor drivers available. On top, runs a micro-ROS app that is in charge of passing the distance measurements to the software controlling the arm kinematics. This communication is mediated by a Raspberry Pi 4 bridge, through which the arm is instructed to grab the object with millimetric precision and relocate it in a different position.
  
Tasks of this kind can be integrated into a bigger and more complex operations chain, as building blocks of a fully automated protocol, relevant to sectors such as that of warehouses discussed above.

<a id="source-posts-2020-07-24-foxy-release-md"></a>

We are glad to announce the release of micro-ROS Foxy and its compatibility with ROS 2 Foxy and Fast DDS 2.x.

micro-ROS Foxy supports new hardware platforms in addition to the reference Olimex STM32-E407 evaluation board, namely the Crazyflie 2.1 Drone and ST Discovery IoT kit (B-L475E-IOT01A),
and new Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOSes) in addition to the already supported NuttX, specifically FreeRTOS and Zephyr v2.3.0.

It uses the eProsima middleware Micro XRCE-DDS 1.3.0, fully compatible with the latest version of eProsima Fast DDS 2.0 for ROS 2 Foxy.

micro-ROS Foxy also features the implementation of the RCLC, an additional API that complements the ROS Client Support Library (RCL).
The RCLC library is written in the C language and implements functionalities of the standard ROS 2 RCLCPP layer, adapting them to the capabilities and needs
of the low-resource devices targeted by micro-ROS. Among them, the LET Executor and the Lifecycle.
The RCLC Executor provides a C API to manage the execution of subscription and timer callbacks, similar to the RCLCPP Executor.
It is optimized for resource-constrained devices and provides additional features that allow the manual implementation
of deterministic schedules with bounded end-to-end latencies.
The RCLC Lifecycle package provides convenience functions in C to bundle an RCL node with the ROS 2 Node Lifecycle state machine, similar to the
RCLCPP Lifecycle Node.

Finally, new demos and examples, combining the different hardware platforms and RTOSes supported and written in the new RCLC API,
have been added to the already very complete pool of out-of-the-box and easy to use micro-ROS examples.

Additionally, bug fixes and improvements have been implemented in the RMW and Micro XRCE-DDS Client library.

For a complete list of improvements and bug fixes please read the [release notes](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_setup/releases).

<a id="source-posts-2020-08-27-esp32-md"></a>

The micro-ROS team is glad to announce that the pool of boards officially supported by the project has widened! The [ESP32 MCU](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) is now part of the family. ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth, widely used for both commercial and industrial purposes.

<img alt="ESP32 board" src="img/_posts/esp32_cut.png" width="70%"/>

micro-ROS targets mid-range and medium-to-high performance 32-bits microcontrollers families. Up to now, the boards officially supported by the project were solely based on the STM32 series from ST, MCUs featuring ARM Cortex-M processors. On the other hand, the ESP32 is an ultra-low power consumption dual-core system with two Xtensa LX6 CPUs, exposing a large collection of peripherals.

Specifically, the port has been carried out for an Espressif [ESP32-DevKitC-32E](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits/esp32-devkitc), an entry-level development board featuring an [ESP32-WROOM-32E](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-wroom-32e_esp32-wroom-32ue_datasheet_en.pdf) module integrating Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functions. The port makes use of FreeRTOS, one of the three [RTOSes](https://micro-ros.github.io/_docs/concepts/rtos/) officially supported by the micro-ROS project, which is natively used by this family of boards, and supports the latest Foxy release of ROS 2. It works both with serial and Wi-Fi transports, the latter being particularly appealing as it marks the first hardware support of the micro-ROS project that exploits a natively integrated Wi-Fi antenna. Therefore, thanks to the combination of this highly capable Espressif board with micro-ROS, users will be able to develop wireless ROS2 applications that take advantage of the huge set of peripherals that ESP32 offers: I²C, SPI, I²S, LED drivers, PWM, etc. Furthermore, the ESP32-DevKitC-32E development board perfectly fits the typical requirements of the IoT systems targeted by micro-ROS, as it features a Flash memory of 4 MB, 448 KB ROM for booting and core functions, 520 KB SRAM for data and instructions and 16 KB SRAM in RTC.

The recent port of micro-ROS to ESP32 thus sets a milestone towards expanding the family of MCUs supported by micro-ROS and paves the way for further ports, ensuring this project an ever wider base of hardware support.

In order to try the new port, follow one of the [core tutorials](https://micro-ros.github.io//_docs/tutorials/core/overview/) to install the micro-ROS build system, and then follow the instructions below: 

```bash

ros2 run micro_ros_setup create_firmware_ws.sh freertos esp32
ros2 run micro_ros_setup configure_firmware.sh int32_publisher -t udp -i [your local machine IP] -p 8888
ros2 run micro_ros_setup build_firmware.sh menuconfig

# Now go to the micro-ROS Transport Settings → WiFi Configuration menu and fill your WiFi SSID and password. Save your changes, exit the interactive menu, and run:
ros2 run micro_ros_setup build_firmware.sh

# Connect your ESP32 to the computer with a micro-USB cable, and run:
ros2 run micro_ros_setup flash_firmware.sh
```

In order to open an agent you can find instructions [here](https://micro-ros.github.io/_docs/tutorials/core/first_application_linux/) but we recommend using the docker image:

```
docker run -it --rm --net=host microros/micro-ros-agent:foxy udp4 --port 8888 -v6

```

<a id="source-posts-2020-09-03-memo-prof-xrcedds-md"></a>

In response to the growing interest of the community in micro-ROS, a thorough benchmarking of the most relevant figures that are key to the product adoption is in demand.

As a first step towards this direction, we recently performed a [memory footprint analysis](https://www.eprosima.com/index.php/resources-all/performance/micro-xrce-dds-memory-profiling) of the [Micro XRCE-DDS](https://micro-xrce-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/) library, the middleware underlying the micro-ROS architecture.

The Micro XRCE-DDS Client library profiling has been performed for two simple applications, one publishing and the other subscribing to topics of known size, running on FreeRTOS, chosen by virtue of its memory management capabilities, and on an Olimex STM32-E407 board, which is the reference board of the micro-ROS project. The board is connected by serial transport (UART) at 115200 baud to a Micro XRCE-DDS agent running on a Linux machine. Notice that the XRCE-DDS Client is completely dynamic memory free, so all memory figures refer to the stack and static memory usage.

The results for this analysis are summarized in the graphs below for publisher and subscriber applications, respectively.

* **Publisher Applications**:
  
  <img alt="Results for Micro XRCE-DDS publisher application" src="img/_posts/overall_pub.png" width="80%"/>

* **Subscriber Applications**:
  
  <img alt="Results for Micro XRCE-DDS subscriber application" src="img/_posts/overall_sub.png" width="80%"/>


On the server side, we have investigated the memory consumption of an Agent communicating with a mock Client application on Linux that is publishing and subscribing to topics of known size, by measuring the binary size of the compiled agent (which resulted to be of 385 KB) and analysing heap and stack usages. The results for the latter are summarized in the plot below.

<img alt="Results for Micro XRCE-DDS agent" src="img/_posts/Memory_usage_XRCE-DDS_Agent.png" width="60%"/>

For more information regarding the methodology employed for performing these profilings, refer to the full report published on [eProsima](https://www.eprosima.com/)'s webpage.

<a id="source-posts-2020-09-18-freertos-blog-md"></a>

[FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/index.md) is a market-leading and widely used Real Time Operating System (RTOS) for microcontrollers and embedded systems, built with an emphasis on reliability and ease of use. It was one of the first RTOSes to be integrated into micro-ROS' modular software stack through the [build system](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_setup), which enables reuse of virtually all the tools and features provided by the FreeRTOS community and partners. In a recent [post](https://www.freertos.org/2020/09/micro-ros-on-freertos.md) published on the [FreeRTOS blog](https://www.freertos.org/blog.md), we offer a technical and detailed recount on why FreeRTOS makes a lightweight and ideal RTOS over which running micro-ROS.

<img alt="FreeRTOS logo" src="img/_posts/logo-freertos.jpg" width="80%"/>


Two successful cases of integration of FreeRTOS with hardware relevant for micro-ROS’ typical target applications are the [Crazyflie 2.1 drone](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/crazyflie-2-1/) and the [ESP32 MCU](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32). The Crazyflie software makes profitable use of several FreeRTOS’ tools and functions, and a demo example of a micro-ROS application working with FreeRTOS on the Crazyflie can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDnSpWhkfZQ&t=14s). As for the second hardware, natively integrated with FreeRTOS and offering a ready-to-use Wi-Fi antenna and Bluetooth function, a very recent [port of micro-ROS](https://discourse.ros.org/t/micro-ros-porting-to-esp32/16101) has been carried out and practical demos are in line.

Good news is that, as the users base of both micro-ROS and FreeRTOS is rapidly expanding and compelling use-cases pop up, further integration of micro-ROS with the libraries offered by FreeRTOS and FreeRTOS+ is foreseen in the very near future.

Stay tuned!

<a id="source-posts-2020-09-23-snap-xrcedds-md"></a>

In collaboration with [Canonical](https://canonical.com/), we took the liberty to wrap the [Micro XRCE-DDS Agent](https://micro-xrce-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/agent.md) as a [snap](https://snapcraft.io/) package, which sets an important milestone for easing the use of Micro XRCE-DDS.

<img alt="Canonical" src="img/_posts/canonical.png" width="35%"/>

Snap is a package manager designed to bundle and handle applications and their dependencies on several Linux distros, among which Ubuntu.

<img alt="Snap" src="img/_posts/snap2.png" width="45%"/>

The snap packaging of the Agent comes with two ways of running it: as a simple executable or by means of a Linux service.

The first implies the usage of the Agent’s built-in CLI, where you can specify the standard configuration parameters (such as transport, port…) directly, as follows:
```
micro-xrce-dds-agent <transport> <args>
```

The second launches the Agent as a Linux service running in the background; to do so, simply execute:
```
snap set micro-xrce-dds-agent daemon=true
```
In this case, instead of specifying the Agent’s launch parameters via the CLI, users can configure them thanks to the `snap services` interface, using the `snap set micro-xrce-dds-agent <param>=<value>` command. These parameters’ values are only valid when the `daemon` option is set to `true`, while they are ignored in `snap run` mode.

Given the closeness of the two Agents libraries, a snap release of the micro-ROS Agent is just one step away!

<a id="source-posts-2020-09-24-microros-and-fiware-md"></a>

On September 23rd, the [FIWARE Foundation](https://www.fiware.org/foundation/) held a webinar titled “Enabling Robotics Systems on Microcontrollers”, as a part of its series of free webinars about open source platform components for Smart Solutions.

The webinar focused on the interoperability between micro-ROS and FIWARE, made possible by [eProsima Integration-Service](https://integration-service.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/) and its core SOSS. SOSS is a platform that acts as a centralizing bridge to communicate incompatible protocols that speak different languages. Its working principle rests on System-Handles, plugins that put the core into communication with each of the protocols that are meant to be integrated into the platform. Once a system is integrated by means of a dedicated System-Handle, it can speak with any other system that is already integrated into the SOSS world.
The SOSS-ROS2 and the SOSS-FIWARE System-Handles serve as key enablers to integrate micro-ROS into the FIWARE ecosystem, a framework of open source platform components which can be assembled together and with other third-party platform components to accelerate the development of Smart Robotics Solutions. 

Key contributions of Powered by FIWARE architectures to micro-ROS applications are:

* Interfacing with the Internet of Things (IoT), Robots and third-party systems, for capturing updates on context information and translating required actuations.
* Context Data/API management, publication, and monetization, bringing support to usage control and the opportunity to publish and monetize part of managed context data.
* Processing, analysis, and visualization of context information implementing the expected smart behavior of applications and/or assisting end users in making smart decisions

<a id="source-posts-2020-09-30-discovery-md"></a>

micro-ROS is now implementing client/server handshaking by discovery!

The discovery mechanism allows micro-ROS Clients to discover Agents in the network by UDP. If a Client doesn’t know of any Agent beforehand, it sends a discovery call by multicast and the reachable Agents respond by sending information about them, such as their IP and port. The Client matches automatically with the first Agent that provides information, and the communication between the matched entities proceeds in the usual way.

<img alt="Discovery" src="img/_posts/discovery.png" width="60%"/>

micro-ROS inherits its discovery mechanism from the [Micro XRCE-DDS library](https://micro-xrce-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/client.html#discovery-profile), which is then implemented in the RMW layer. Discovery is accessible by default at the Client level when using UDP transport, and can be activated in the Agent by using the `-d` flag when running it from terminal with the [snap command](https://discourse.ros.org/t/micro-xrce-dds-agent-now-on-snap/16523):
```
micro-xrce-dds-agent udp4 <args> -d
```
If you’re running instead the daemonized version of the Agent via the provided snap service, you can turn on the discovery mechanism like this:
```
snap set micro-xrce-dds-agent discovery="true"
```

## Source: `_posts/2020-10-05-moveit.md`
<a id="source-posts-2020-10-05-moveit-md"></a>

We have packaged and delivered a new demo to showcase the integration between micro-ROS and [MoveIt 2](https://moveit.ros.org/), a manipulation framework for robotic applications created and maintained by [PickNik](https://picknik.ai/), especially designed to interoperate with ROS 2. The final result is displayed with the ROS visualization tool [Rviz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz).

We designed the demo in such a way that the MoveIt 2 manipulation and planification algorithms causes a virtual arm to reach out to the board as this is being moved in real space and publishes data on its position and orientation to the ROS 2 ecosystem.

With this demo we bring micro-ROS to a whole different level: thanks to MoveIt’s kinematic planification talent, an app running on a microcontroller is enabled to be integrated into complex algorithms and ROS 2 workflows. This allows all robots in micro-ROS’ ecosystem to perform actual ‘stunts’ of all types.

To run micro-ROS, we employ a [STM32L4 Development IoT kit](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l475e-iot01a.md) in combination with [Zephyr](https://zephyrproject.org/). The board offers several general-purpose I/O pins and peripherals to communicate its 32-bits microcontroller with the external world. It also includes many sensors. For this demo, we make use of a 6-DoF Inertial Measurement Unit (LSM6DSL), composed of an accelerometer and a gyroscope, and a 3-DoF magnetometer (LIS3MDL). The fusion of the measurements fetched by these sensors outputs the pose, or [quaternion attitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation), of the board, providing its relative orientation with respect to a fixed reference frame.
The pose data is then forwarded to the ROS world, where it is consumed by both Rviz and MoveIt. The former uses it directly to represent the position and orientation of the board in its graphical interface, while MoveIt uses it to calculate the movement that the virtual arm has to perform to "touch" it, according to its kinematic algorithms for motion planning. The resulting movement is then integrated into Rviz and represented by means of its [virtual Panda robotic arm](https://github.com/ros-planning/panda_moveit_config), a standard tool employed by MoveIt in tutorials and graphic interfaces.

<a id="source-posts-2020-11-12-graphs-md"></a>

We are getting every day closer to bringing the complete ROS 2 feature list into micro-ROS. Our last effort towards this direction is the inclusion of a dedicated graph manager into the micro-ROS Agent and Client’s RMW, marking the first big divergence point between the former and the Micro XRCE-DDS Agent, and providing micro-ROS with unprecedented introspection capabilities.

To do so, we have added a DDS participant into the Agent that scans the network in search of the available ROS 2 entities (nodes, publishers, subscribers, services and so on), and publishes them onto a specific topic, which is listened to by the RMW. From this layer, the ROS 2 graph information is fetched by the upper layers and passed to the user.

This is complemented by the ability of micro-ROS to also inject information about its own ROS 2 entities into the ROS 2 global dataspace, so that users executing graph-related tasks can gather information about which micro-ROS entities are present at the moment.


<img alt="Graphs" src="img/_posts/graph.png" width="100%"/>

This year's ROSCon, due to the pandemic, has been transformed into a virtual event, full of awesome presentations and discussions, the [ROS World 2020 Conference](https://roscon.ros.org/world/2020/)!

We have been hosted by the [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/) parallel track session, and the presentation circled around micro-ROS’ latest features and developments, after a due, though brief, introduction to the project. Among the topics that were discussed:

- [micro-ROS twofold build system approach](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_setup/pull/190)
- Integration into [Arduino](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_arduino), [Zephyr](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_zephyr_module) and [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_espidf_component) development frameworks
- Client-Agent matching by [discovery](https://discourse.ros.org/t/discovery-in-micro-ros/16611)
- [Graph support](https://discourse.ros.org/t/graph-support-in-micro-ros/17266)
- p2p functionality (WIP)
- [New demo: micro-ROS & MoveIt](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro-ROS_moveit2_demo)
- [micro-ROS goes AIoT](https://discourse.ros.org/t/micro-ros-goes-aiot/17407): integration with [DephtAI](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/), by [LUXonis](https://luxonis.com/)

And that’s not it! micro-ROS will be also present as a featured guest in a bunch of other talks by collaborators and friends, among which Nuno Marques from the [Dronecode Foundation](https://www.dronecode.org/) and Francisco Melendez from FIWARE.

We’re working with the [LUXonis](https://luxonis.com/) team on the integration of micro-ROS with an exciting AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things) project, involving the [DepthAI BW1092 board](https://shop.luxonis.com/products/bw1092). This small device enables interacting with LUXonis [DepthAI](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/) SoM from an [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) microcontroller.

<img alt="LUXonis DepthAI" src="img/_posts/depthai.jpeg" width="100%"/>

DepthAI is a platform built around the [Myriad X](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/processors/movidius-vpu/movidius-myriad-x.md) which combines depth perception, neural inference and object tracking, all accessible via a Python API and a plug/play SoM with open-source hardware. It comes integrated with a variety of platforms, and in the case of the board we use for our project, it brings these capabilities to the embedded world.

The DepthAI BW1092 features three cameras (a general one, plus two allowing for stereoscopic vision), making it possible to run 3D object detection out of the box. In turn, this allows retrieving the metadata coming out of a Neural Network, running inside the Myriad X processor, into the development environment of the ESP32 MCU. Thanks to the integration with micro-ROS, it will be possible to bring these data to the ROS 2 ecosystem, exposing ROS 2 topics with the results of classification networks with spatial vision coming out of an embedded device.

If we get lucky with the integration we might be seeing soon our next PointCloud message coming directly from the DepthAI spatial vision calculations!

<a id="source-posts-2020-11-20-is-md"></a>

OFERA partner [eProsima](https://www.eprosima.com/) has been working on a demo combining several of its cutting-edge technologies. The demo shows how two separate ROS 2 dataspaces hosted by distinct subnets can be put into communication over the WAN thanks to [Fast DDS TCP capabilities](https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/fastdds/transport/tcp/tcp.md) and to [Integration Service](https://integration-service.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/), the tool enabling intercommunication of any protocol with [Fast DDS](https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/). The setup consists of a ROS 2 node publishing velocity directives over the internet to a Turtlesim application and to a micro-ROS node operating a Kobuki Turtlebot2, both running on the remote hub.

In the first dataspace we have a ROS 2 publisher sending data over a Twist type message. More in detail, a *joy node* is in charge of obtaining displacement commands from a gamepad, which are then converted into ROS 2-understandable Twist type messages by a second *teleop_twist_joy node*.

The second dataspace handles two subscribers which receive the Twist topic sent by the *teleop_twist_joy node*. The first subscriber is a Turtlesim application, in charge of displacing the classic virtual turtle in its graphical interface according to the indications received by the remote node. The second subscriber is a micro-ROS Client, communicated with the ROS 2 dataspace via an Agent which allows it to subscribe to the Twist topic. With the data received, micro-ROS is in charge of instructing a Kobuki Turtlebot2, operated by an [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) MCU running [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/index.md), to move accordingly.

The remote communication is mediated by Integration Service, which is able to translate the ROS 2 messages into a language understandable by Fast DDS, and thanks to the TCP capabilities of the latter it connects via WAN the instances launched in the two subnets. Thanks to this, we can see how both the Kobuki robot and the Turtlesim are moving as they are being operated by the remote gamepad.

<a id="source-posts-2020-11-24-arduino-md"></a>

As in the last months more and more users have been manifesting an intrest in having micro-ROS on [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), we have been working in order to make this integration come to life.

Arduino is an IDE designed to fit into extremely resource-constrained devices, offering an easy-to-use framework for programming MCUs among which, especially, a vast suite of development boards carrying the Arduino brand.

<img alt="Logo Arduino" src="img/_posts/Arduino_Logo.svg" width="50%"/>

Based on this and on our recent release of a straight-to-the-point [micro-ROS standalone library](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_setup/pull/190), which was already successfully integrated with the [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_espidf_component) and [Zephyr build system](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_zephyr_module), we were able to give support to the Arduino IDE.

At present, it has already been ported it to several boards, namely: the the OpenCR 1.0, the Teensy 3.2 and 4.0/4.1, the Arduino Zero and the Arduino Due.

This new integration is especially interesting in that it paves the way for a bare-metal support for micro-ROS.

After reviewing our most recent accomplishments and dusting off our To-Do list, we drafted the roadmap for the next months of development and designed an exciting plan for the ROS 2 Galactic release.

Our priorities will be:

- Migrating all functionalities to the `rclc`, so as to convert it into the default micro-ROS user API and an independent abstraction layer on top of the  `rcl`. Namely, the missing features to achieve this goal are:
  - Implement parameters in `rclc`, together with a dedicated parameters manager in the Agent.
  - Migrate actions to the `rclc`, as we recently did with services.
  - Migrate graphs to the `rclc`, based on their recent implementation both in the `rmw` and in the Agent.
- Adapt micro-ROS packages and CI to the rolling release before Galactic is out.
- Implement and polish a mature peer-to-peer functionality to achieve brokerless communication among Clients.

Additional improvements: continue to improve the stability and extend the capability of the middleware layer, evaluating which efforts are worthy to be addressed (e.g. implement multi-threading).

<a id="source-posts-2020-12-01-warehouse-duties-md"></a>

In this brand new demo, micro-ROS showcases its capabilities in an environment that mimics a realistic industrial scenario like a smart warehouse, comprising a dynamic and distributed system of heterogeneous IoT devices. The demo was designed, orchestrated and recorded by OFERA partner [PIAP](https://piap.pl/en/).

It presents a mobile platform interacting with a set of sensors and actuators based on microcontrollers running micro-ROS over 6LoWPAN and scattered in a simulated warehouse area, both indoor and outdoor, and is meant to show the seamless integration of these basic elements into a complex ROS 2 ecosystem thanks to micro-ROS.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8L1XVsZMmsI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The mobile base is a *scout* robot designed for quick recognition of the surroundings, thanks to a localisation system providing coherent information on the platform position, and it features an on-board computer running a ROS 2 node. A regular computer is connected to the system via Wi-Fi, with which the ground station operator defines the tasks building up the overall mission, provides the required "world model" to execute it, and interchanges messages with the robot. An autonomy module is then in charge to drive the robot all the way down to the mission accomplishment.

During its trajectory, the robot steps into a series of environmental devices, with which it intercommunicates when they are within the range of the wireless 6LoWPAN protocol, namely:

- A humidity and temperature sensor from which it fetches measurements and sends them to the ground station operator;
- A door which can be opened remotely;
- A ToF (Time of Flight) sensor measuring distances and communicating whether the path is clear;
- A light that can be turned on and off.

The communication is mediated by a micro-ROS Agent running on the on-board computer, which connects to the various micro-ROS Clients operating the sensors and actuators listed above as the robot moves across the simulated warehouse. In all devices, micro-ROS is running on an [Olimex LTD STM32-E407](https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/ST/STM32-E407/open-source-hardware) board, on top of the [NuttX](https://nuttx.apache.org/) RTOS.

Like the [XRCE-DDS Agent before](https://micro-ros.github.io/_posts/2020/09/23/snap-XRCEDDS/) it, now the micro-ROS Agent has been wrapped and delivered as a [snap package](https://snapcraft.io/micro-ros-agent), too!

[Snap](https://snapcraft.io/) is a package manager designed to bundle and handle applications and their dependencies on several Linux distros, like Ubuntu.

<img alt="Snap" src="img/_posts/snap2.png" width="45%"/>

We prepared the Agent snap release in collaboration with [Canonical](https://canonical.com/). It comes with two ways of running it: as a simple executable or by means of a Linux service.

<img alt="Canonical" src="img/_posts/canonical.png" width="35%"/>

The first implies the usage of the Agent’s built-in CLI, where the user can specify the standard configuration parameters (such as transport, port…) directly, as follows:

```
micro-ros-agent <transport> <args>
```

The second launches the Agent as a Linux service running in the background; to do so, simply execute:

```
snap set micro-ros-agent daemon=true
```

In this case, instead of specifying the Agent’s launch parameters via the CLI, users can configure them thanks to the snap services interface, using the `snap set micro-ros-agent <param>=<value>` command. These parameters’ values are only valid when the daemon option is set to true, while they are ignored in snap run mode.

The full list of configurable parameters can be found [here](https://snapcraft.io/micro-ros-agent).

On June 23rd 2021, we presented micro-ROS at the [ROSCOn France](https://roscon.fr/) as invited speakers to contribute to the topic: micro-ROS: bringing ROS 2 to microcontrollers

This session was presented by several partners of this project. The main objectives of this session were to introduce the micro-ROS framework, its architecture and current maturity as well as the default middleware Micro XRCE-DDS.

First, Maria Merlan (eProsima) presented in detail a very clear and easy to follow introduction on how to bring ROS-2 to microcontrollers and the micro-ROS middleware architecture and the supported platforms.

<embed src="/download/2021-07-04-rosconfrance2021.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="450px"/>

Secondly, Jan Staschulat (Bosch)  gave us precisions on the architecture and how to code with rclc.

Finally Pablo Garrido (eProsima) performed a live demonstration on “using micro-ROS with the [ESP32 board](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32)”.

The presentation was very well received. For example the ROSCon organizer Olivier Strasse [said](https://discourse.ros.org/t/roscon-fr-2021-report/21104): "This chat was actually extremely lively and contribute to further improving participation by French roboticists in global open source robotics activities. All the participants of ROSCon Fr 2021 benefited from their participation."

At the end, they had a public chat with numerous questions by the French robotics community.
We are happy about having been participants in the ROSCon France 2021 and therefore  contribute to further dissemination of the micro-ROS framework as well as to improve participation by French roboticists in global open source robotics activities.

[micro-ROS](/) Foxy, Galactic and Rolling provides a new enhancement, the multithreading feature. 

Multithreading allows the micro-ROS default middleware (Micro XRCE-DDS) to be thread safe. This way, micro-ROS nodes can run ROS 2 entities such as publishers, subscribers or services in different RTOS execution threads.
As a result, micro-ROS will run in a multi threaded approach under specific circumstances, improving the performance, the usability and resource optimization.

The multithreading mechanism together with shared memory [transport](https://discourse.ros.org/t/shared-memory-implementation-available-now-in-micro-ros/20422?u=mamerlan) contribute to provide a highly flexible environment for deploying micro-ROS nodes with isolated functionality in different RTOS tasks or threads. As always, in a build-time configured way with no usage of dynamic memory.

→ To activate this new feature, just enable the Multithreading [flag](https://github.com/eProsima/Micro-XRCE-DDS-Client/blob/3e2a144b44add2a789ecdfd116686c981738839e/CMakeLists.txt#L65) in your middleware configuration using your colcon.meta file.

These features are supported in Micro XRCE-DDS, the micro-ROS middleware implementation.

See the associated PRs in the Micro XRCE-DDS library ([General](https://github.com/eProsima/Micro-XRCE-DDS/pull/85), [Client](https://github.com/eProsima/Micro-XRCE-DDS-Client/pull/224), [Agent](https://github.com/eProsima/Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent/pull/239)) and in micro-ROS’ Client RMW and Agent.

<a id="source-posts-2021-07-21-handlingmemorymessages-md"></a>

Having total awareness of what ROS 2 messages and types are being used for, is essential in order to handle memory correctly in an embedded C99 environment. 

The following Tutorial “Handling messages memory in micro-ROS '' at [icro-ROS web page](/_docs/tutorials/advanced/handling_type_memory/) explains in detail how to handle messages and types memory in micro-ROS. 

The two approaches of micro-ROS memory handling are present in this tutorial.

micro-ROS Foxy: Memory handling using traditional allocation approach.

micro-ROS Galactic: Memory handling using type support introspection.

Type Support introspection in C in micro-ROS Galactic distribution enables the new type handling API. This package is able to auto-assign memory to a certain message structure using default dynamic memory allocators. 

Thanks to the inclusion of this feature, an automated memory handling for micro-ROS types is available, enhancing the usability of the micro-ROS API.

The tools related to this feature are available in the package [micro_ros_utilities](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_utilities) and the documentation is available [here](/_docs/api/utils/).
Check this [example](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_arduino/blob/galactic/examples/micro-ros_types_handling/micro-ros_types_handling.ino) for more information about how to avoid the message memory initialization problems in micro-ROS.

<a id="source-posts-2021-08-10-timeoutrmw-qos-md"></a>

There are NEW APIs available to improve the usability and scope of micro-ROS:
 
- The new [RCLC QoS API](https://github.com/ros2/rclc/pull/119/) allows users to set custom QoS to better adjust the use cases. 
So far, users could only use default or best effort entities. Now, this API allows the user to set a whole rmw_qos_profile_t. All internal QoS available in RMW as well as the entities can be customized to adjust every use case.  
The RCLC QoS API applies to all entities. 
 
- The new [RMW timeout API](https://github.com/micro-ROS/rmw-microxrcedds/pull/153) helps the user to configure the publication time block time when using a reliable mode in micro-ROS.
When a topic is published in reliable mode in the RMW of Micro XRCE-DDS, the XRCE-DDS session will be run during a default time-out before sending an error, in order to confirm that the messages arrive to the Agent. This default timeout used to be managed by a buit-time configurable parameter. 
The new RMW API allows the user to set a specific value for the timeout parameter at run-time for each reliable publisher, meaning before publishing. 
 
This brings advantages:	
  - Users can control the blocking time of a reliable publication.
  - Users can reinforce time constraints to adjust the behaviour to their use case, allowing to fine-tune the timing of micro-ROS publisher operations.
 
These enhancements are in line with the strategy of improving usability and scope of micro-ROS. We thank the community and early adopters for their great insights that contribute to enhancing micro-ROS usability and to better focus real use cases.

Alexandru Kampmann currently works at the Software for Embedded Systems Research Group, RWTH Aachen University, and he is the main contributor of [embeddedRTPS](https://github.com/embedded-software-laboratory/embeddedRTPS)

Middleware implementations such as embeddedRTPS, bring the possibility of using RTPS communication layers on mid to high range MCU with networking capabilities.

Thanks to the layer to layer compatibility of micro-ROS with the ROS 2 architecture, testing those new middlewares is just a matter of writing a new RMW implementation. As well as making some porting adjustments due to the embedded nature of micro-ROS.


From the eProsima’s micro-ROS team we want to provide the same features to the official ROS 2 embedded solution.

So, we have created a basic [rmw_embeddedrtps for micro-ROS](https://github.com/micro-ROS/rmw_embeddedrtps), that, although it is not complete, allows the basic functionality of publishing, subscribing and using ROS 2 services. All of this using the well-known micro-ROS C99 API: rclc.

**micro-ROS can be compiled either with Micro XRCE-DDS for low-mid MCUs or with embeddedRTPS for larger devices that are used in critical applications. So, the developer can easily choose the preferred middleware for any application.**

## Source: `_posts/2021-12-01-RCLCactions.md`
<a id="source-posts-2021-12-01-rclcactions-md"></a>

micro-ROS already supported the ROS 2 communication paradigms (pub/sub, services, parameters, lifecycle….)
From now on, micro-ROS also supports actions. This means that the RCLC now is fully completed and enables all ROS 2 features.

Therefore, the full integration with all ROS 2-based interfaces can be achieved from the plain C micro-ROS API. Also, it provides specific features such as a real time executor or static memory handling. 

The [RCLC Actions Implementation](https://github.com/ros2/rclc/pull/170) in micro-ROS supports most of the well-known features of actions like goal requests, goal cancels, feedback and so on. All of them use the dynamic-memory-free micro-ROS usual approach.

They will be included in [RCLC Rolling release v3.0.5](https://github.com/ros2/rclc/releases/tag/3.0.5)
